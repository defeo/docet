# About this website

[{{ site.title }}]({{ site.baseurl }}) was created by
{{ site.authors | map: 'name' | array_to_sentence_string }}.
{% if site.license %}Its contents are distributed under the
[{{ site.license.name }}]({% include utils/joinpath.str root=site.baseurl base='' path=site.license.url %}){% endif %}.


### How to use/edit this site

This is a
[*static website*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page)
automatically generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) by
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). The source code is
[available on GitHub]({{ site.github.repository_url }}){% if site.license %}
and you are allowed to use it under the terms of the
[{{ site.license.name }}]({{ site.license.url }}){% endif %}.

You are a teacher, a student, or a casual visitor and want to learn
how to improve this site, this help page is for you!


### Editing pages

You can edit any page by clicking on the
[<i></i>{:.icon.fa.fa-edit} Edit](#) link in the top menu.
{% if site.create %}You can also add new pages by clicking on the
[<i></i>{:.icon.fa.fa-plus} New](#) link.{% endif %}

This will drop you in
{%if site.prose%}[Prose](http://prose.io/){%else%}GitHub{%endif%}'s
file editing interface, where you can modify the source code, preview
it, and save your changes by giving a short description of what you
modified. If you are a collaborator to this website, and have
[write access](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-the-different-access-permissions/)
to [the GitHub repository]({{site.github.repository_url}}), your
modifications will be published right away.  If you do not have write
access, you will be asked to
[fork the repository and make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
See also the [next section](#forking-the-website-for-your-own-use).

Most of the pages are written in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which is a
textual format for generating formatted text. Markdown syntax is very
intuitive, you can get a quick review
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) or
[here](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html).

{% unless site.prose %}
**CAVEATS:** The Markdown engine used by this site is
[Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/). Its syntax definitions are
slightly different form
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/),
thus the preview feature in GitHub might not render source as in the
final result.

Other reasons why GitHub's preview may not correspond to the final
results are:

- Use of
  [Liquid templates](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers)
  in the source. This is seldom used, but some pages (like
  [this one]({{ github_blob }}/{% include utils/rel_path.str %}))
  use them to access site-wide configuration variables.
- Use of special purpose markup, HTML, and scripts, such as
  mathematical excerpts written in [MathJax](http://mathjax.org/).

### *Forking* the website for your own use

You want to get a copy of the website and its source code to analyze
it, or make your own derivative of it, this is very easily done, even
if you're not (yet!) the technical type.

All you need is a [GitHub account](http://github.com/). Once your
account is setup,
[forking the repository]({{site.github.repository_url}}/fork) will
create your own copy in your GitHub account.
{% if site.github.is_project_page %}Now go to the settings page and
rename your repository to ***username*.github.io** (replace *username*
by your GitHub user name).{% endif %}

Now you can make changes to your own copy of the site. Edit some
files, save the changes, and examine the result. The compiled static
site will be served at
**https://*username*.github.io/{% unless site.github.is_project_page %}{{site.github.project_title}}{% endunless %}**
(replace *username* by your GitHub user name).

**Note:** the website will not be compiled when you first fork the
repository. If you want your fork to be served on **github.io** before
committing any changes, you will have to
[create a local clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork)
of your fork, then
[push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/). This
will not create any new commit, but will force GitHub to compile your
copy of the site. In a Unix shell, this is

~~~
git clone git@github.com:username/{{ site.github.project_title }}.git
cd {{ site.github.project_title }}
git push
~~~



### Contributing your changes back to this site

You have forked the repository, made your changes, and now want to
contribute them back to the site, but you do not have write access.

[Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
are GitHub's standard way of contributing changes back to the original
repository.  You can
[make a pull request for this repository]({{site.github.repository_url}}/compare),
your changes will be reviewed and integrated back once they are
accepted.


### Working locally

You want to do more than the occasional editing, or you want to deeply
modify the code to make your own site.
{%if site.prose%}Prose{%else%}GitHub{%endif%}'s editor and preview are
too limited for this, and handling git history via GitHub's web
interface becomes too clumsy at this point. You need to work locally
on your computer.

All you need to work locally is a [Git client](http://git-scm.com/).
[Clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork)
and start coding right away.

At some point, you will need to preview your work, but pushing to
GitHub each time you want to preview is clumsy. Your best option is to
[install Jekyll and the required dependencies](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#installing-jekyll)
on your machine. It is recommended to install the
[GitHub pages gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) which provides
you with the exact same versions used by GitHub to compile your site.

If you already have Ruby `≥{{ site.github.versions.ruby }}`, the
install part should be as easy as

~~~
gem install github-pages
~~~

Note that you will need Ruby headers (`ruby-dev` package on Ubuntu) in
order to compile C dependencies.

Now you can `cd` into your local clone of the repository and launch
the compilation by

~~~
jekyll serve --baseurl ''
~~~

Your site will be generated in a `_site` sub-directory, and served
live at <http://localhost:4000/>. Any changes to the sources will
trigger an automatic recompilation!

Have fun coding!

{% unless site.github.is_project_page %}
**Note:** you will notice that the source for the site is in a branch
mysteriously called `gh-pages`. If you are familiar with Git, this
will surprise you as the usual branch name for Git repositories is
`master`. This special name is where all the GitHub pages magic comes
from: name your branch `gh-pages`, and GitHub will automatically
compile it when you push.

### Starting from scratch

This website was created from an empty template at
<https://github.com/elementsLMS/eLeMentS/>.  You can start from
there if you want to create a website for your own class.
