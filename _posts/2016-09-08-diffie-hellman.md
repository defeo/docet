## The beginnings of public key cryptography

Cryptography, helping lovers since 2000 BC

> O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
> Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
> Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
> And I'll no longer be a Capulet. 
{:.cite style="white-space:pre-line"}

**Confidentiality:** Has Tybalt seen the message?

**Authenticity:** Is the message really from Juliet?

**Integrity:** Is the message exactly what Juliet meant to send?

...**and:** Secret sharing, homomorphic encryption, multiparty
computation, plausible deniability, anonimity, proofs of knowledge,
proofs of work, ...

### Secret key (symmetric) cryptography

Romeo and Juliet have met in the Capulet's orchard.  Upon falling in
love, they have agreed on a *secret key* **S**.

- Known since the ancient times;
- Widely used during war times, played a key role in WWII;
- The *cryptanalytic* efforts of WWII gave birth to the modern computer
  (ever heard of **Enigma**, **Alan Turing**, **Bletchley Park**,
  **Colossus**, ...)
  
  ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5e/The_Imitation_Game_poster.jpg)
  {:.centered}
  
- With a little care, secret key cryptography achieves
  **confidentiality**, **authenticity** and **integrity**.

### The birth of public key (asymmetric) cryptography

The modern day Romeo and Juliet have only met on Tinder. They want to
share their most intimate secrets in a **confidential** way, but the
Internet is fraught with pirates, hackers, governments, and tech-savvy
Italian moms wanting to spy on their messages.

**Can Romeo and Juliet establish a *common secret* by chatting on a
  public channel without having ever met before in person?**

#### 1976: *New directions in cryptography*

### The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol (abstract version)

Let $$G$$ be a finite cyclic group, noted multiplicatively, generated
by an element $$g∈G$$.

- $$G$$ is abelian,
- Let $$N$$ be the order of $$G$$,


|**Romeo** || **Juliet**
| Picks $$0<a<N$$ at random; || Picks $$0<b<N$$ at random;
| Computes $$A = g^a$$; || Computes $$B = g^b$$;
|| $$—A→$$
|| $$←B—$$
| Computes $$S = B^a = g^{ba}$$ || Computes $$S = A^b = g^{ab}$$
{:.box}

---

Ok, $$S$$ is a common *something*. **But is it a secret?**

**Lady Capulet** is spying on Romeo and Juliet's conversation:

- She knows $$G$$, $$N$$ and $$g$$;
- She sees $$A$$ and $$B$$.

How can she recover $$S$$?

Let's see an [example with $$G=ℤ/Nℤ$$]({% include nbviewer.url url='assets/jupyter/2016-09-08-diffie-hellman.ipynb' %}).

---

### *Hard* problems

Let $$G$$ be a cyclic group of order $$N$$.

> #### Discrete logarithm
> Let $$g,A∈G$$, the *discrete logarithm* $$\log_g A$$ is the unique
> integer $$0≤a<N$$ such that $$g^a=A$$.
{:.box}

Discrete logarithm problem (DLP)
: Given $$g,A∈G$$, find $$\log_g A$$.

Computational Diffie-Hellman problem (CDH)
: Given $$g,A,B∈G$$, find $$S$$ such that $$S = A^{\log_g B} =
B^{\log_g A} = g^{(\log_g A)(\log_g B)}$$.

> #### Security reductions
>
> Obviously: **CDH → DLP** (if you can solve DLP, you can solve CDH);
>
> Conjectured: **DLP → CDH**.
{:.box}

---

### Computational security

We cannot hope *discrete logarithm* to be unsolvable for any group. But
we can hope it to take **VERY LOOONG** to solve.

> #### Cost of secret generation
>
> *Square-and-multiply* exponentiation algorithm:
>
> $$a ↦ g^a = (\underbrace{g^{⎣a/2⎦}}_{\text{recursive call}})^2 · g^{a\bmod 2}$$
>
> - $$⎡\log_2 N⎤$$ recursive calls;
> - one or two group operations at each call.
>
> **Total cost:** $$O(\log N)$$ *group operations*.
{:.box}

We say that DLP (or CDH) is *hard* in $$G$$ if no algorithm solves it
in polynomial time in $$\log N$$.

- DLP is clearly **not hard** in $$(ℤ/Nℤ, +)$$.
- DLP is at worse exponential in $$\log N$$ (hint: test all exponents
  $$<N$$).
- Advanced algorithms (Baby step-giant step, Pollard
  rho) solve DLP in $$O(\sqrt{N})$$.
- By the Chinese remainder theorem, this can be reduced to
  $$O(\sqrt{p})$$, where $$p$$ is the **largest prime factor** of
  $$N$$ (Pohlig-Hellman).

And if you know a little about complexity theory:

- DLP is in NP.
- If P = NP, then DLP is **not hard** for any group.
- Since we do not know whether P = NP, we do not know any group with
  hard DLP.

... But we can still **conjecture** that DLP is hard for some
groups...

---

### The classical Diffie-Helman protocol

Let $$q$$ be a prime, the *modular integers* $$ℤ/qℤ$$ form a
finite field, also written $$\FF_q$$.

Denote by $$\FF_q^*$$ the *multiplicative group of units* of
$$\FF_q$$.

That is all elements of $$\FF_q$$, except $$0$$, with group operation
given by multiplication.

- $$\FF_q^*$$ is cyclic of order $$q-1$$;
- A generator of $$\FF_q^*$$ can be computed easily using
  Lagrange's theorem.

If $$q-1$$ has a **large prime factor**, the DLP in $$\FF_q^*$$
**seems to be hard**!

[An example]({% include nbviewer.url url='assets/jupyter/2016-09-08-diffie-hellman.ipynb#Diffie-Hellman-with-$\mathbb{F}_q^*$' %}).

---

### Capulet in the middle

It is easy to prove that if CDH is hard, then the Diffie-Hellman key
exchange is **secure against passive adversaries**.

However, if Lady Capulet can intercept messages on Tinder and
manipulate them...

---

|**Romeo** || **Lady Capulet** || **Juliet**
| Picks $$0<a<N$$ at random; || Picks $$0<c<N$$ at random; || Picks $$0<b<N$$ at random;
| Computes $$A = g^a$$; || Computes $$C = g^c$$; || Computes $$B = g^b$$;
|| $$—A→$$ || $$—C→$$
|| $$←C—$$|| $$←B—$$
| Computes $$S = C^a = g^{ca}$$ || Computes $$S = A^c = g^{ac}$$
||| Computes $$S' = B^c = g^{bc}$$ || Computes $$S' = C^b = g^{cb}$$
|| $$⇐S⇒$$|| $$⇐S'⇒$$
{:.box}

---

### Public key encryption

Instead of an *ephemeral key*, Juliet has a *long term* **secret key**
anyone can use to send her private message.

> #### Public key encryption system
>
> Key pair
> : A pair $$(K_p, K_s)$$ (*public key*, *secret key*),
> : $$K_p$$ is publicly known (published on Juliet's Tinder profile).
>
> Encryption algorithm $$\Enc(K_p, m)$$
> : Inputs: public key $$K_p$$ and a *message* $$m$$;
> : Output: a *cyphertext* $$c$$.
>
> Decryption algorithm $$\Dec(K_s, m)$$
> : Inputs: secret key $$K_s$$ and a *cyphertext* $$c=\Enc(K_p, m)$$;
> : Output: the *message* $$m$$.
{:.box}

**Security properties:**

- Only the owner of $$K_s$$ can decrypt cyphertexts encrypted with
  $$K_p$$.
- It is easy to derive a key exchange protocol from a PK encryption one.
- The other direction is harder.

**First ever encryption protocol:** RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman 1977)

- Based on hardness of integer factorization;
- Already known to GCHQ by 1973.


---

### From Diffie-Hellman to PK encryption: the El Gamal protocol (1985)

##### Parameters

- Finite field $$\FF_q$$;
- Generator $$g∈\FF_q^*$$;

##### Keys

- **Secret key:** random $$0<a<q-1$$;
- **Public key:** $$K_p = g^a$$;


> #### Encryption
>
> **Input:** Public key $$K_p$$, a message $$m∈\FF_q^*$$;
>
> 1. Pick random $$0≤b<q-1$$;
> 2. Compute $$c_1 = g^b$$;
> 3. Compute $$s = (K_p)^b$$ (*shared secret*);
> 4. Compute $$c_2 = m·s$$;
>
> **Output:** The cyphertext $$(c_1, c_2)$$.
{:.box}

> #### Decryption
>
> **Input:** Secret key $$a$$, a cyphertext $$(c_1,c_2)∈\FF_q^* × \FF_q^*$$;
>
> 1. Compute $$s = c_1^a$$ (*shared secret*);
> 2. Compute $$m = c_2 · s^{-1}$$;
>
> **Output:** The message $$m$$.
{:.box}

CDH hard ⇒ El Gamal is secure

---

### Signatures

But how does Juliet know that the message is really from Romeo?

> #### Public key signature system
>
> Key pair
> : A pair $$(K_p, K_s)$$ (*public key*, *secret key*),
> : $$K_p$$ is publicly known (published on Romeo's Tinder profile).
>
> Signature algorithm $$\Sig(K_s, m)$$
> : Inputs: secret key $$K_s$$ and a *message* $$m$$;
> : Output: a *signature* $$s$$.
>
> Verification algorithm $$\Ver(K_p, m, s)$$
> : Inputs: public key $$K_p$$, a *message* $$m$$, a *signature* $$s$$;
> : Output: OK if $$s = \Sig(K_s, m)$$, FAIL otherwise.
{:.box}

**Security property:**

- Only the owner of $$K_s$$ can sign messages for $$K_p$$.
- Security proofs for signature protocols are usually much more
  complicated than for encryption protocols. We will not discuss them.

**Signatures are hard:**

- No automatic way to obtain a signature algorithm from PK encryption;
- RSA signature, introduced together with RSA;
- Signatures from Diffie-Hellman: Schnorr signature (1988), DSA (1991).


---

### Schnorr signatures

##### Parameters

- Finite field $$\FF_q$$;
- Generator $$g∈\FF_q^*$$;
- A *hash function* $$H: \{0,1\}^* → \FF_q^*$$;

##### Keys

- **Secret key:** random $$0<a<q-1$$;
- **Public key:** $$K_p = g^a$$;

> #### Signature
>
> **Input:** Secret key $$a$$, a message $$m∈\{0,1\}^*$$;
>
> 1. Pick random $$0≤b<q-1$$;
> 2. Compute $$r = g^b$$;
> 3. Compute $$e = H(m \| r)$$;
> 4. Compute $$s = b - a·e$$;
>
> **Output:** The signature $$(s, e)$$.
{:.box}

> #### Verification
>
> **Input:** Public key $$K_p$$, a message $$m$$, a signature $$(s, e)$$;
>
> 1. Compute $$r = (K_p)^e · g^s$$;
> 2. Compute $$e' = H(m \| r)$$;
>
> **Output:** OK if $$e = e'$$, FAIL otherwise.
{:.box}

---

### Final remarks

- A weaker form of signatures gives *authentication protocols*. These
  can be combined with key exchange protocols to obtain a key exchange
  secure in presence of **active adversaries**.

- All along we have assumed that we trust Tinder to correctly present
  Romeo and Juliet's public keys. But what if Lady Capulet manipulates
  Tinder? Distributing public keys in a safe manner requires a trust
  infrastructure (Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), web of
  trust, ...). This is a complex subject, out of the scope of this
  course.

## Modern day key exchange

### Generic attacks on DLP

Let $$G$$ be a cyclic group of order $$N$$, let $$g$$ be a generator.

**DLP:** Given $$h = g^a$$, find $$a$$.

##### Baby-step/giant-step, Pollard Rho

**Idea:** look for *collisions* of the form

$$g^x = h^y,$$

then $$a = x/y \mod N$$.

- **Baby-step/giant-step:** time/memory tradeoff, $$O(\sqrt{N})$$ time and memory;
- **Pollard Rho:** random walk, based on *birthday paradox*,
  $$O(\sqrt{N})$$ time, constant memory.

##### Pohlig-Hellman

Suppose $$N = p_1·p_2 \cdots p_n$$, by the Chinese remainder theorem

$$G ≃ ℤ/Nℤ = ℤ/p_1ℤ × ℤ/p_2ℤ × \cdots x ℤ/p_nℤ,$$

- Solve a discrete logarithm in each of $$ℤ/p_iℤ$$ (using BSGS,
  Pollard Rho, ...),
- Lift the solution using CRT.

**Complexity:** $$O(\sqrt{p})$$, where $$p$$ is the largest factor of $$N$$.

---

### Sub-exponential algorithms for finite fields

$$L_N(α,c) = \exp(c\log(N)^α · \log\log(N)^{1-α})$$

- $$L_N(0,·)$$ polynomial complexity,
- $$L_N(1,·)$$ exponential complexity.

##### Index calculus

- First discovered by Gauss;
- Based on the concept of *smooth* elements.

> #### Smooth element
>
> We say that an integer is $$B$$-smooth if it is
> the product of primes $$<B$$.

> #### General index calculus
>
> **Input:** $$g,h∈\FF_q^*$$,
> **Output:** $$\log_g(h)$$.
>
> 1. Choose a smoothness basis $$\mathcal{B} = \{x\;\vert\; x<B\}$$;
> 2. Choose a field generator $$b∈B$$;
> 3. Compute the discrete logs base $$b$$ of all elements of $$\mathcal{B}$$:
>    
>    - Collect enough *relations* of the form
>      
>      $$\prod (b_i)^{e_i} = 1;$$
>
>    - Put them in a matrix, use linear algebra to find each discrete log;
> 4. Rewrite $$g$$ and $$h$$ as products of elements of $$\mathcal{B}$$;
> 
> **Output:** $$\log_g(h)$$.
{:.box}

##### Index calculs variants

- **Classical:** $$B\sim L_N(1/2,·)$$, complexity $$L_N(1/2,·)$$.

- **Number Field Sieve:** $$B\sim L_N(1/3,·)$$, complexity
  $$L_N(1/3,·)$$; suitable for $$\FF_q$$ with $$q$$ prime or a small
  prime power.

- **Function Field Sieve:** $$B\sim L_N(1/3,·)$$, complexity
  $$L_N(1/3,·)$$; suitable for $$\FF_q$$ with a large prime power.

- **Quasi-polynomial (Barbulescu, Gaudry, Joux, Thomé 2011):**
  $$B\sim (\log N)^{O(1)}$$, complexity $$O((\log N)^{\log\log N})$$,
  suitable for $$\FF_q$$ of very small characteristic.

---

### Secrity levels

It is usually assumed that **unfeasible** amounts of computation start
at $$\sim 2^{80}$$ elementary operations.

For good measure

- A CPU @1GHz can do $$2^{30}$$ elementary ops/sec;
- Amazon EC2 cloud is reported to have delivered (in 2013) approx
  $$2^{50}$$ ops/sec at a rate of $$0.5$$ $/sec;
- The **distributed** Bitcoin infrastructure delivers (in 2016) more
  than
  [$$2^{60}$$ ops/sec](https://blockchain.info/en/charts/hash-rate?scale=1&timespan=all);
- *Exascale* computing ($$2^{60}$$ ops/sec) is
  [expected to arrive by 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exascale_computing).

### Elliptic curves

#### Projective space

Let $$k$$ be a field, the *projective space* $$\PP^2(k)$$ is the set
of all lines in $$k^3$$ **passing through the origin**.

Equivalently, it is the set of triples

$$(X:Y:Z) ≠ (0:0:0),$$

up to the equivalence relation

$$(X:Y:Z) \sim (λX:λY:λZ).$$

---

#### Elliptic curves

An elliptic curve over a field $$k$$ (of characteristic $$>3$$) is the
set of *projective solutions* of an equation

$$E \;:\; Y^2Z = X^3 + aXZ^2 + bZ^3,$$

with $$a,b\in k$$, with a *distinguished point* (the *point at
infinity* $$(0:1:0)$$).

---

#### Group law

The *chord and tangent law*

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/ECClines.svg){: style="width:100%"}

Let's work out [some examples]({% include nbviewer.url url='assets/jupyter/2016-09-08-diffie-hellman.ipynb#Elliptic-curves' %})

---

#### Hasse's theorem

> #### Theorem
>
> Let $$E/k$$ be an elliptic curve defined over a finite field $$k$$,
> then the number $$\#E(k)$$ of *rational points* of $$E$$ is bounded
> by
>
> $$\abs{\#E(k) - q + 1} ≤ 2\sqrt{q}.$$
{:.box}

##### Bonus

- All cardinalities in the interval are attained;
- There tend to be more curves toward the middle (see
  [Sato/Tate conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sato%E2%80%93Tate_conjecture)).

##### ECDLP

- Choose $$\FF_q$$ with e.g. $$q\sim 2^{256}$$;
- Take curves at random;
- Use the
  [Schoof-Elkies-Atkin point counting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoof%E2%80%93Elkies%E2%80%93Atkin_algorithm)
  to compute $$\#E(\FF_q)$$;
- Stop once you have found a curve with **prime order**.

### Quantum computing

##### Classical computers

- Elementary states (bits): either **0** or **1**;
- Elementary transformations (boolean gates): **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, ...;
- Information can be copied at will.

##### Quantum computers

- Quantum states (qubits): *a mix of **0** and **1***;
- Elementary transformations (quantum gates), *reversible*:
  **Hadamard**, **CNOT**, **Pauli X**, **Y** and **Z**, **CNOT**, **Toffoli**, **Fredkin**, ...;
- Quantum information *collapses* to a classical state when read;
- *No-cloning theorem*: information cannot be copied at will.

#### [Quantum cats](http://www.approachingreality.org/)

---

### Qubit

##### Mathematically
  
- Just an element of $$ℂ^2/ℝ$$.

- Usually represented on a basis $$\bk{0}, \bk{1}$$:

  $$|φ〉 = α\bk{0} + β\bk{1},\qquad α,β ∈ ℂ$$

  where $$\abs{α}^2 + \abs{β}^2=1$$.

- When *observed* (*measured*), we only obtain a *pure state*
  $$\bk{0}$$, or $$\bk{1}$$ (with probabilities $$\abs{α}^2$$ and
  $$\abs{β}^2$$, resp.).

##### Phisically
  
- an atom with two possible energy states $$\bk{0}$$ and $$\bk{1}$$,
- a photon with two possible polarizations,
- ...

---

### Entanglement

Two or more qubits can become *entangled*, also called a *superposition state*.

##### Mathematically
  
- Qubits exists as *tensor products* of states, rather than as *cartesian products*,

- e.g., the possible states for two qubits are

  $$|φ〉 = α\bk{0}⊗\bk{0} + β\bk{0}⊗\bk{1} + γ\bk{1}⊗\bk{0} + δ\bk{1}⊗\bk{1},\qquad α,β,γ,δ ∈ ℂ$$

  where $$\abs{α}^2+\abs{β}^2+\abs{γ}^2+\abs{δ}^2 = 1$$.

- The dimension of the *state space* grows **exponentially** with the number of qubits!

- Measuring collapses the state onto a classical one.

> #### *Spooky action at a distance* (EPR)
> - Entanglement can be carried over long distances;
> - Tested experimentally over [hundreds of km](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/520886/japanese-telco-smashes-entanglement-distance-record/);
> - ...very hard to maintain for a long time even locally, though.
{:.box}

---

### Quantum circuits

##### Quantum gates

- *Unitary* matrices acting over the state space.
- **Reversible**, because **physics is** (at small scale, at least).
- Small set of **elementary gates** (similar to **AND**,
  **OR**, ...).

##### Quantum circuits

- Networks of elementary quantum gates;
- **Reversible:** no measuring happens before the very end.

---

### The most dangerous quantum circuit ever

**Quantum Fourier transform** (QFT)

- Computes a Fourier transform of a **quantum state**,
- Circuit size **polynomial** in the number of qubits →
  **logarithmic** in the size of the state space.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Peter_Shor.jpg)

##### Peter Shor's *period-finding* algorithm

- Finds the *period* of a function $$ℤ/Nℤ → ℤ/Nℤ$$, in $$O(\log N)$$ quantum steps;
- Immediate application to DLP;
- Classical reduction from Integer factoring.
